# Modeshape for OpenNCA
This is a fork of the original Modeshape 5.4.0 code. The primary changes
made to the original code include:
- An update to the Elasticsearch index code.
- Some minor updates to the query processing.
- Some changes to provide for recognition of CSV files for the
purpose of setting the correct mime type.

The original README.md file is preserved in the README-original.md file.
