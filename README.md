However, some paid licenses contribute to the code base. 

AG Grid Free/Commerical: https://github.com/ag-grid
AG Grid is used to display tabular data in the application. The OpenNCA product is designed to operate under the free version in the abscence of a license, without the enhanced sorting/filtering capabilities of the commercial version. 

HighCharts: https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts
Highcharts is used for the analysis module, and requires a developer license to be purchased for modifications
